                I got started in 1988 when my co-founder and I built the first software company to accelerate Unix
                graphics with dedicated graphics hardware on PC hardware. We ported the X Window System and accelerated
                it with gear you wouldn't believe existed 35 years ago. We cut deals with NCR and Unix System Labs, and
                eventually I sold the technology to Quarterdeck. That was also when I registered x.com, back in 1993,
                one of only three single-letter .com domains that IANA ever released.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                In early 1999, Elon Musk wanted x.com for his new financial services company. He was not well known in
                those days, but I liked him, so we worked out a deal for cash and equity. Within a year that company
                merged with Confinity and became PayPal. I moved on to build netdrive.com, one of the first cloud
                storage services, years before anyone called it "cloud." I negotiated a deal to sell netdrive to Visto
                and I ended up running business development for them, where I wrote the strategy to pivot the company
                into mobile email infrastructure. Visto later acquired Good Technology and was itself bought by
                BlackBerry.

            <p class="prose">
                After that I spent several years as a partner in a small investment bank helping tech companies with
                cross border deals between the US and China, and actually lived in Beijing for a couple of years back
                around the time of Beijing Olympics in 2008, it was a different world back then. I wrote for New Atlas
                as a tech journalist, and you can still find some of my old articles on the site if you search for my
                name. And in the years running up to the pandemic, I started a technology company in Singapore that did
                deep tech thermodynamics research in partnership with NTU, creating fundamental technology for
                ultra-efficient air conditioning and atmospheric water generation.

                These days I am focused on giving people control over their own computing. The big platforms are useful,
                but the tradeoff is that your data becomes their product. I think there is room for alternatives.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                I am working on two projects. <strong>Scaean Gateway</strong> is a software network gateway that brings
                enterprise-class security to regular home and small office networks. You install it once and every
                device on your network gets protection automatically, no configuration needed.
                <strong>StrixForge</strong> turns a Strix Halo PC or laptop into a proper AI workstation without needing
                a PhD in system administration. Both are about the same idea: serious tools, built for normal people,
                that do not require handing your data to someone else.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                I am a lifelong technophile and I have been building this stuff for almost 40 years. I just think you
                should own what is yours.
