                    Internet pioneer and entrepreneur with 35+ years building foundational computing infrastructure. Registered x.com in 1993, one of three single-letter .com domains ever released. Currently developing open source privacy computing platform as alternative to surveillance-based cloud services.

                <p class="intro">
                    Co-founded Pittsburgh Powercomputing in 1988 with Marcel DePaolis. First company to use exotic graphics hardware to accelerate Unix, Xenix, and Linux on x86 systems. Developed X Window System server software and secured major technology partnerships with NCR and Unix System Labs, where we wrote the loadable driver interface for Unix System V. Negotiated acquisition by Quarterdeck Office Systems (of QEMM fame) to merge our technology with DESQview, their multitasking DOS product that predated Windows, making X Window System their new GUI.
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                    In April 1993, registered x.com, one of only three single-letter .com domains ever released by IANA before the remaining 23 were permanently reserved. Ran x.com as private email service for six years.
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                    In early 1999, sold x.com (the domain) to Elon Musk for cash plus equity stake in his new company X.com (the financial services company), which merged with Confinity to become PayPal. Met regularly with Musk during X.com's early development. According to Jimmy Soni's book "The Founders," Musk described the negotiation: "those bastards insisted on equity."

                <p class="intro">
                    Founded netdrive.com in 1998, one of the first cloud storage services enabling remote file access via web interface, built before "cloud computing" was a term. Pioneered concepts that became standard in services like Dropbox and Google Drive a decade later.

                <p class="intro">
                    Career spans multiple foundational computing shifts: Unix graphics acceleration, early commercial internet, cloud storage, mobile email infrastructure, venture capital, hardware development, and privacy computing. Founded Disruptive Thermodynamics (originally Aquifer Labs) in 2013 to develop ultra-high efficiency hybrid air conditioning and atmospheric water generation systems. Managed international operations across Hong Kong and Singapore, securing a strategic partnership with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore for research collaboration and technology development.

                    Developing open source privacy computing infrastructure through Disruptive Scientific. Primary project is Scaean Gateway, a network security appliance with four core capabilities: full-speed VPN gateway achieving 2.5GbE throughput (10GbE with higher-spec hardware), transparent LAN bridging across multiple physical locations, built-in tracking and anti-fingerprinting protection, and enterprise-grade security. Technology preview releasing early 2026.
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                    Scaean Gateway is the first visible component of a larger privacy computing platform. The platform includes a distributed cloud OS, privacy-focused browser, and AI-integrated applications for communications and productivity. It's designed to replace surveillance-dependent cloud services with user-controlled alternatives. Additional projects include local-first AI systems and privacy-preserving application suite.
