                I got started in 1988 when my co-founder and I built the first company to accelerate Unix graphics on PC hardware. We wrote X Window System servers and device drivers, partnered with NCR and Unix System Labs, and eventually sold the technology to Quarterdeck. That was also when I registered x.com, back in 1993, one of only three single-letter .com domains that IANA ever released.

            <p class="prose">
                In early 1999, Elon Musk wanted x.com for his new financial services company. We worked out a deal for cash and equity. That company merged with Confinity and became PayPal. I moved on to build netdrive.com, one of the first cloud storage services, years before anyone called it "cloud." It got acquired, and I ended up running business development for Visto, where I helped pivot the company into mobile email infrastructure. Visto later acquired Good Technology and was itself bought by BlackBerry.

                After that I spent several years doing venture capital between the US and China, wrote for New Atlas as a tech journalist, and then went deep on hardware R&D. I ran a company in Singapore developing thermodynamic systems in partnership with NTU, building ultra-efficient air conditioning and atmospheric water generators.

                These days I am focused on giving people control over their own computing. The big platforms are useful, but the tradeoff is that your data becomes their product. I think there is room for alternatives.

                I am working on two projects. <strong>Scaean Gateway</strong> is a software network gateway that brings enterprise-class security to regular home and small office networks. You install it once and every device on your network gets protection automatically, no configuration needed. <strong>StrixForge</strong> turns a Strix Halo PC or laptop into a proper AI workstation without needing a PhD in system administration. Both are about the same idea: serious tools, built for normal people, that do not require handing your data to someone else.

                I am not anti-technology. I have been building this stuff for 35 years. I just think you should own what is yours.
