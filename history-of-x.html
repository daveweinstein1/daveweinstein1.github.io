                I wrote this in 2019 to give to Jimmy Soni while he was researching the PayPal era in his book "The
                Founders: The Story of Paypal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley". It's 384 pages covering
                one of the most consequential companies in Silicon Valley history. Marcel and I get about a quarter
                page. That feels about right.

            <h3>The Early History of X.com</h3>

            <p class="prose">
                In the era that x.com was originally registered, the Internet was a very different environment compared
                to the decades of explosive growth that were soon to follow. Back in 1988, as Marcel DePaolis and Dave
                Weinstein started their first company, Pittsburgh Powercomputing, there was no consumer Internet to
                speak of. It was more like an exclusive and tightly controlled club being predominantly the realm of
                government agencies, universities, and a handful of very large technology-oriented companies. It
                typically required the sponsorship of an existing member to join. Over the next couple of years this
                policy was gradually loosened such that an ordinary company might consider its own domain registration.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                In those early days, the contract for managing domain names for NSFNET (the National Science
                Foundation's precursor to what we now call the Internet) was handled by Network Telesystems. They were
                responsible for maintaining a list of existing names as well as name reservations for networks that were
                going to be implemented later. So around 1990 we reserved ppc.com (the registered trademark initials of
                our company) for later use.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                For the few small businesses who were aware of and managed to deploy email at all, it was usually
                relayed via dial-up modem at up to 14.4kbps using the UUCP protocol. A carefully configured email server
                in your office would call your service provider (later known as an ISP) many times per day to deliver a
                batch of outbound messages and retrieve any available as addressed to your domain. This service provider
                was then responsible for storing and forwarding the outbound email to other customers or providers using
                various peering protocols. It was possible to have a direct full-time data connection at 56kbps or even
                1.5Mbps using exotic network gear and special leased lines but it was VERY expensive.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                Fast forward about two years and our small company was finally ready to invest the money in hardware and
                services to activate our email domain. We called up our provider to make arrangements and got a rude
                awakening. It turned out that in early 1992, NSF was given authority by the U.S. Congress to allow
                commercial entities onto the NSFNET which was the first step to becoming the Internet as we know it
                today. At that point the contract for managing DNS information was taken over by Network Solutions and
                all those reservations that Network Telesystems had taken got tossed into the trash. We were shocked to
                discover that someone else had managed to register our ppc.com! Our immediate reaction was to fight for
                it, but a few calls with our lawyer convinced us that there was little to nothing we could really do
                since at this dawn of the commercial Internet there was no legal connection between a domain name and a
                trademark. So, being a small company with limited resources, we were screwed.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                With no viable options left, we decided to just pick a new domain name. The company's business was
                building X Window System server software, so we figured that we should get a name that at least
                reflected that since we couldn't use a name that was our name. Keep in mind this was still an era of
                information scarcity. We were still 2 years away from the introduction of Netscape's first browser and
                there wasn't even a good "whois" to check for domain availability because many networks weren't even
                connected. The normal procedure was to fill out a form and FAX it in to your service provider, then wait
                a few weeks to see if it was taken. We didn't like that at all and were still irritated about losing our
                name. We wanted a definite and confirmed answer immediately for a replacement!
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                So we went old-school, simply called up Network Solutions and asked to talk to their network operations.
                Back in 1992 NOBODY called them for tech support and usually the only people who called at all were the
                network admins from universities and research labs. Thus it was fairly easy to get through and talk to
                someone actually connected to their internal network operations. We explained the situation and asked if
                they could check a few name choices using the internal "whois" on their network to see if they were
                available before we placed an order. After trying several options, the best one available was clearly
                "x.com". We couldn't quite believe it and had them double check to see if it was not only free, but also
                allowed. All good on all counts.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                Next call was to our local ISP, who told us in no uncertain terms that (a) one letter domain names were
                illegal, (b) that we needed to pick a name at least three letters long, and (c) if they sent in the form
                as requested it would be immediately rejected. At this point, Dave stepped up with his best Zaphod
                Beeblebrox imitation and said, "I just got off the phone with network operations at Network Solutions
                five minutes ago and they assured me that it was not only permissible, but also available. So you let me
                worry about whether it's OK and you just send in the form the way we're asking you to!" Apparently it
                worked, the sysop decided it was easier to send in a form that he was SURE would be rejected than to
                argue with us (spoiler alert: it wasn't rejected). Network Solutions, having no explicit policy against
                one letter names, simply approved our request. After "x", "q", and "z" slipped through the ".com" nets
                in the first year of this new service model, the arrival of 1993 saw the IANA (the Internet Assigned
                Numbers Authority) simply reserve the remaining 23 letters for theoretical future purposes, effectively
                ending the race for single letter domains.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                This was the year Marcel and Dave sold Pittsburgh Powercomputing Corp's software assets to a public
                company that doesn't exist anymore. The fact that they didn't want the regulatory hassle of getting SEC
                approval and other compliance paperwork required to acquire our small company motivated them to just buy
                specific items and hire our staff, but NOT buy the rest of the company. They weren't even interested in
                our domain because they "already had one". So x.com stayed with us after the sale and we just used it
                for our own personal email service (remember this is STILL before commercial web browsers, three years
                before Hotmail, and more than a decade before Gmail). We kept that running for about six years
                occasionally creating email accounts for friends and family. Even at the peak of our tenure, there were
                only about 50 email users.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                Occasionally we'd be contacted by an individual or company that was interested in buying "x.com", but
                nearly all were uninteresting deals. And none were even worth giving up our convenient email service.
                Until one day in 1999, and under the looming shadow of Y2K, we were approached by Elon Musk who wanted
                to start his second company, an online bank. We checked him out and liked his story and plan. Feeling
                optimistic about the situation, we were able to reach a deal that seemed fair to us and the new X.com.
                We used to meet for breakfast or lunch in Palo Alto about once a month to catch up with Elon and to get
                updates on X.com's progress. Despite the rumors of a $1M price tag, the actual deal was a combination of
                a small amount of cash and a modest equity stake in the new company. Over time we were pleased to see
                our confidence was well placed.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                In the end we liked Elon and believed in him as a fellow entrepreneur. The deal worked out well. We
                stayed in touch for a while through those early PayPal years, but eventually life took us in different
                directions. We had a front-row seat to the beginning of something significant.
